# ChronoZombies

## Project Vision
"ChronoZombies" is not just a game; it's a carefully crafted educational tool designed to entertain while instilling valuable life skills. Set in a post-apocalyptic world where time itself is a resource as precious as any survival gear, this game challenges players to manage their time effectively to survive against the relentless waves of zombies.
The core of "ChronoZombies" revolves around strategic decision-making with each round acting as a mini lesson in prioritisation and resource management. Players must decide how to spend their time each day within the game, choosing between scouting for resources, fortifying their safe sones, rescuing survivors, or resting.
The educational goal is to mirror these strategic decisions with real-life time management challenges. Whether it's meeting deadlines, managing workloads, or balancing personal and professional life, the skills developed in "ChronoZombies" are transferrable and intended to have a lasting impact on players' real-world behaviours and choices.
